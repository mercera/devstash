Dashboard UI — Phase 3

## Status

<!-- Not Started|In Progress|Completed -->

Completed

## Goals

<!-- Goals & requirements -->

Phase 3 of 3 for the dashboard UI layout. Build out the main area to the right
of the sidebar, replacing the `Main` placeholder in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

- The main area to the right
- 4 stats cards at the top — total items, collections, favorite items and
  favorite collections (not in the screenshot)
- Recent collections
- Pinned items
- 10 recent items

## Notes

<!-- Any extra notes -->

- Full spec: @context/features/dashboard-phase-3-spec.md
- Target look: @context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png, @context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-drawer.png
- Mock data: @src/lib/mock-data.ts — read through the getters
  (`getCollectionsWithCounts`, `getRecentCollections`, `getPinnedItems`,
  `getRecentItems`, `getFavoriteItems`, …), never the raw arrays.
  The spec links `mock-data.js`; the file is TypeScript
- Previous phases: @context/features/dashboard-phase-1-spec.md, @context/features/dashboard-phase-2-spec.md
- Tailwind v4 — theme config goes in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme`, no `tailwind.config` file
- The stats cards have no counterpart in the screenshot, so their look has to be
  derived from the rest of the design
- `src/lib/icons.ts` already maps type icon names and accent colors — reuse it
  for the card accents and item rows rather than adding new mappings
- The dashboard page can stay a server component; only the sidebar needs `"use client"`

## History

<!-- Keep this updated. Earliest to latest -->

### Initial Setup — Completed (2026-08-24)

Scaffolded the Next.js client with Tailwind CSS v4.

- Bootstrapped Next.js (React 19) + TypeScript project
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 via `@theme` in `src/app/globals.css` (no `tailwind.config` file)
- Replaced the default landing page in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Removed unused Create Next App SVGs from `public/`
- Added `CLAUDE.md` and the `context/` docs (project overview, coding standards, AI interaction, current feature)
- Renamed the default branch `master` → `main`
- Committed as `chore: initialize next.js client with tailwind css` and pushed to `origin` (https://github.com/mercera/devstash.git)

### Mock Data Layer — Completed (2026-08-25)

Added the single source of truth for dashboard mock data.

- Created `src/types/index.ts` with `User`, `ItemType`, `Collection`, `Item` and
  the joined view types (`ItemWithRelations`, `CollectionWithCount`, …)
- Created `src/lib/mock-data.ts` with 7 system item types, 6 collections,
  16 items and a mock current user
- Added derived getters for the sidebar, collection cards, pinned/recent
  sections and search
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass

Design decisions carried forward:

- `src/types/index.ts` mirrors the Prisma draft in `context/project-overview.md`
- The UI reads through the getters (`getItemTypesWithCounts`,
  `getCollectionsWithCounts`, `getPinnedItems`, `getRecentItems`, `searchItems`, …),
  never the raw arrays
- Counts are **derived** from the `items` array rather than hardcoded, so the
  sidebar and collection cards stay consistent as mock items are added
- Tags are flattened to `string[]` on `Item`. The database will model these
  through `Tag`/`ItemTag`, but the UI only ever renders names
- `color` on types and collections is a semantic name (`"blue"`, `"purple"`, …)
  that the UI maps to Tailwind classes — no inline styles
- Swapping to Prisma later should be a one-file change: the getters already
  return the joined shapes the UI expects

### Dashboard UI — Phase 1 — Completed (2026-08-26)

Built the dashboard shell: ShadCN setup, `/dashboard` route, top bar, and sidebar/main placeholders. Branch `feature/dashboard-phase-1`.

- Initialized ShadCN UI (`radix` base, `nova` preset) — added `components.json`, `src/lib/utils.ts`, and the CSS-variable theme in `src/app/globals.css`
- Installed the `button` and `input` components into `src/components/ui/`
- Dark mode by default via the `dark` class on `<html>` in `src/app/layout.tsx`; renamed the Geist font variables to `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` so the ShadCN theme tokens resolve, and added `--font-mono` to the `@theme inline` block
- Replaced the leftover "Create Next App" metadata with DevStash title/description
- Added `/dashboard` — `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` composes the top bar, sidebar and `<main>`; `page.tsx` renders the `Main` placeholder
- Added `src/components/dashboard/TopBar.tsx` — wordmark, centered search input with icon, and a display-only "New Item" button
- Added `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` — fixed-width `aside` with the `Sidebar` placeholder, hidden below `md` until the phase 2 drawer lands
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass; `/dashboard` prerenders as static

Built before `origin/main` was pulled, so the reference screenshots and the design
principles in `context/project-overview.md` were not available at the time. The
shell was reviewed against them after the merge and corrected — see the entry below.

### Dashboard UI — Phase 1 Design Match — Completed (2026-08-26)

Reworked the shell to match `context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png`. Branch `fix/dashboard-shell-to-match-design`.

- Moved the logo out of the top bar and into the sidebar: the sidebar is now a
  full-height left column whose header holds the gradient logo tile + `DevStash`
  wordmark, and the top bar spans only the area to its right. Their bottom
  borders line up at `h-12`.
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` is now `[Sidebar][TopBar over main]` rather than
  `[TopBar][Sidebar beside main]`
- Top bar gained the sidebar toggle icon (`PanelLeft`, display only — phase 2
  wires it up) and a "New Collection" outline button
- Search moved from centered to left-aligned after the toggle, capped at
  `max-w-sm`, placeholder shortened to `Search items...`, and a `⌘K` badge added
  inside the field
- Top bar height `h-14` → `h-12` (~48px) to match the reference
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass

Known gaps against the reference, left for later phases:

- The `⌘K` badge hardcodes the mac symbol; platform detection needs a client
  component, and nothing is wired to the shortcut yet
- "New Collection" is not in the phase 1 spec text but is in the screenshot — it
  is rendered display-only

### Dashboard UI — Phase 2 — Completed (2026-08-26)

Filled in the sidebar with mock data and made it collapsible. Branch `feature/dashboard-phase-2`.

- Installed the ShadCN `sidebar`, `collapsible` and `avatar` components (which
  pulled in `sheet`, `tooltip`, `separator`, `skeleton` and `use-mobile`);
  deleted the `dropdown-menu` the CLI also fetched since nothing uses it
- Rebuilt `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` on the ShadCN sidebar
  primitives — header logo, a collapsible **Types** section (icon in the type's
  accent color, count badge, link to `/items/[slug]`), a collapsible
  **Collections** section split into `FAVORITES` (star badge) and
  `ALL COLLECTIONS` (count badge) linking to `/collections/[slug]`, and a footer
  with the avatar, name, email and a display-only settings gear
- Active rows come from `usePathname()`, so `Sidebar` is now a client component
- `TopBar` swapped its `PanelLeft` placeholder for `SidebarTrigger`: offcanvas
  collapse on desktop, Sheet drawer below `md`, plus the built-in ⌘B shortcut
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` now wraps everything in `SidebarProvider` +
  `SidebarInset`; the inner wrapper is a `div` because `SidebarInset` is the `<main>`
- Added `src/lib/icons.ts` — maps `ItemType.icon` names to lucide components and
  `AccentColor` to Tailwind text classes, keeping the data layer React-free and
  the UI free of inline styles
- Added `getRecentCollections(limit?)` to `src/lib/mock-data.ts` (all collections,
  most recently updated first) and made `byUpdatedAtDesc` generic over
  `{ updatedAt: Date }` so it sorts collections as well as items
- Dark `--sidebar` in `globals.css` was lighter than the page background; set it
  to the background value so the sidebar reads as one dark surface like the reference
- Rewrote the generated `src/hooks/use-mobile.ts` with `useSyncExternalStore` —
  the CLI's version failed `npm run lint` under `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass; `/dashboard` still prerenders as static

Decisions worth carrying forward:

- Type links use the singular mock-data slug (`/items/snippet`), not the
  `/items/snippets` in the spec text — the slug is what `getItemsByType` keys on,
  so the route follows the data rather than the other way round
- The spec asks for "most recent collections" while the screenshot labels that
  section `ALL COLLECTIONS` and shows only the non-favorites. Kept the
  screenshot's label and membership, ordered most-recently-updated first
- Collapse is `offcanvas` (the ShadCN default), so there is no icon rail; the
  `tooltip` props were dropped from the menu buttons since they only ever show in
  icon mode, which also avoids needing a `TooltipProvider`
- `/items/[slug]` and `/collections/[slug]` pages do not exist yet — the sidebar
  links point ahead of them

### Dashboard UI — Phase 3 — Completed (2026-08-26)

Built the main dashboard area, replacing the `Main` placeholder. Branch `feature/dashboard-phase-3`.

- Installed the ShadCN `card` and `badge` components
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` now composes four sections under the
  `Dashboard` / "Your developer knowledge hub" header: stats, collections,
  pinned items and recent items. It stays a server component
- Added `src/components/dashboard/StatCard.tsx` — tinted icon tile, tabular
  number and muted label; the page renders four (items, collections, favorite
  items, favorite collections)
- Added `src/components/dashboard/CollectionCard.tsx` — accent left edge, name
  linking to `/collections/[slug]`, star when favorited, item count,
  description and a row of type icons in their own accent colors
- Added `src/components/dashboard/ItemCard.tsx` — shared by the Pinned and
  Recent sections: accent left edge, type icon tile, title with pin/star,
  description, tag badges and the date on the right
- Added `src/components/dashboard/TypeIcon.tsx` — resolves the lucide icon named
  on an item type through `createElement`
- Extended `src/lib/icons.ts` with `getAccentBorderClass` (card left edge) and
  `getAccentTileClass` (tinted icon square)
- Added `getDashboardStats()` to `src/lib/mock-data.ts` and the matching
  `DashboardStats` type to `src/types/index.ts`
- Added `src/lib/format.ts` with `formatShortDate` for the `Jan 15` date column
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass; `/dashboard` still prerenders as static

Decisions worth carrying forward:

- Item rows show `updatedAt`, not the `createdAt` the screenshot displays. Our
  mock data has the two dates diverge, so created dates made the Recent column
  read as unsorted; `updatedAt` is what both sections sort by. The screenshot's
  data appears to have had them identical
- `const Icon = getIcon(...)` followed by `<Icon />` trips
  `react-hooks/static-components`, hence `TypeIcon`. The sidebar was switched to
  it as well so the pattern lives in one place
- The Collections grid shows up to 6 cards from `getRecentCollections(6)` with a
  "View all" link to `/collections`, which does not exist yet
- Item titles are not links — an item detail route has not been specced, and
  phase 3 asks only for the listing
