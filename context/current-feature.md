Dashboard UI — Phase 1

## Status

<!-- Not Started|In Progress|Completed -->

Completed

## Goals

<!-- Goals & requirements -->

Phase 1 of 3 for the dashboard UI layout. Build the shell only — no real data or interactivity yet.

- Initialize ShadCN UI and install the components needed for this phase
- Add a dashboard route at `/dashboard`
- Build the main dashboard layout plus any global styles it needs
- Dark mode by default
- Top bar with search and a "New Item" button (display only, non-functional)
- Placeholder sidebar and main area — just an `h2` with "Sidebar" and "Main" for now

## Notes

<!-- Any extra notes -->

- Full spec: @context/features/dashboard-phase-1-spec.md
- Target look: @context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png
- Mock data: @src/lib/mock-data.ts
- Follow-on phases: @context/features/dashboard-phase-2-spec.md, @context/features/dashboard-phase-3-spec.md
- Tailwind v4 — theme config goes in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme`, no `tailwind.config` file

## History

<!-- Keep this updated. Earliest to latest -->

### Initial Setup — Completed (2026-08-24)

Scaffolded the Next.js client with Tailwind CSS v4.

- Bootstrapped Next.js (React 19) + TypeScript project
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 via `@theme` in `src/app/globals.css` (no `tailwind.config` file)
- Replaced the default landing page in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Removed unused Create Next App SVGs from `public/`
- Added `CLAUDE.md` and the `context/` docs (project overview, coding standards, AI interaction, current feature)
- Renamed the default branch `master` → `main`
- Committed as `chore: initialize next.js client with tailwind css` and pushed to `origin` (https://github.com/mercera/devstash.git)

### Mock Data Layer — Completed (2026-08-25)

Added the single source of truth for dashboard mock data.

- Created `src/types/index.ts` with `User`, `ItemType`, `Collection`, `Item` and
  the joined view types (`ItemWithRelations`, `CollectionWithCount`, …)
- Created `src/lib/mock-data.ts` with 7 system item types, 6 collections,
  16 items and a mock current user
- Added derived getters for the sidebar, collection cards, pinned/recent
  sections and search
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass

Design decisions carried forward:

- `src/types/index.ts` mirrors the Prisma draft in `context/project-overview.md`
- The UI reads through the getters (`getItemTypesWithCounts`,
  `getCollectionsWithCounts`, `getPinnedItems`, `getRecentItems`, `searchItems`, …),
  never the raw arrays
- Counts are **derived** from the `items` array rather than hardcoded, so the
  sidebar and collection cards stay consistent as mock items are added
- Tags are flattened to `string[]` on `Item`. The database will model these
  through `Tag`/`ItemTag`, but the UI only ever renders names
- `color` on types and collections is a semantic name (`"blue"`, `"purple"`, …)
  that the UI maps to Tailwind classes — no inline styles
- Swapping to Prisma later should be a one-file change: the getters already
  return the joined shapes the UI expects

### Dashboard UI — Phase 1 — Completed (2026-08-26)

Built the dashboard shell: ShadCN setup, `/dashboard` route, top bar, and sidebar/main placeholders. Branch `feature/dashboard-phase-1`.

- Initialized ShadCN UI (`radix` base, `nova` preset) — added `components.json`, `src/lib/utils.ts`, and the CSS-variable theme in `src/app/globals.css`
- Installed the `button` and `input` components into `src/components/ui/`
- Dark mode by default via the `dark` class on `<html>` in `src/app/layout.tsx`; renamed the Geist font variables to `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` so the ShadCN theme tokens resolve, and added `--font-mono` to the `@theme inline` block
- Replaced the leftover "Create Next App" metadata with DevStash title/description
- Added `/dashboard` — `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` composes the top bar, sidebar and `<main>`; `page.tsx` renders the `Main` placeholder
- Added `src/components/dashboard/TopBar.tsx` — wordmark, centered search input with icon, and a display-only "New Item" button
- Added `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` — fixed-width `aside` with the `Sidebar` placeholder, hidden below `md` until the phase 2 drawer lands
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass; `/dashboard` prerenders as static

Built before `origin/main` was pulled, so the reference screenshots and the design
principles in `context/project-overview.md` were not available at the time. The
shell was reviewed against them after the merge and corrected — see the entry below.

### Dashboard UI — Phase 1 Design Match — Completed (2026-08-26)

Reworked the shell to match `context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png`. Branch `fix/dashboard-shell-to-match-design`.

- Moved the logo out of the top bar and into the sidebar: the sidebar is now a
  full-height left column whose header holds the gradient logo tile + `DevStash`
  wordmark, and the top bar spans only the area to its right. Their bottom
  borders line up at `h-12`.
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` is now `[Sidebar][TopBar over main]` rather than
  `[TopBar][Sidebar beside main]`
- Top bar gained the sidebar toggle icon (`PanelLeft`, display only — phase 2
  wires it up) and a "New Collection" outline button
- Search moved from centered to left-aligned after the toggle, capped at
  `max-w-sm`, placeholder shortened to `Search items...`, and a `⌘K` badge added
  inside the field
- Top bar height `h-14` → `h-12` (~48px) to match the reference
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass

Known gaps against the reference, left for later phases:

- The `⌘K` badge hardcodes the mac symbol; platform detection needs a client
  component, and nothing is wired to the shortcut yet
- "New Collection" is not in the phase 1 spec text but is in the screenshot — it
  is rendered display-only
